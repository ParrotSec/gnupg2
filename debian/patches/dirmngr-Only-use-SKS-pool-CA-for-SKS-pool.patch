Subject: dirmngr: Only use SKS pool CA for SKS pool

* dirmngr/http.c (http_session_new): when checking whether the
keyserver is the HKPS pool, check specifically against the pool name,
as ./configure might have been used to select a different default
keyserver.  It makes no sense to apply Kristian's certificate
authority to anything other than the literal host
hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.
