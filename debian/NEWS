gnupg2 (2.2.27-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 2.2.27-1, per-user configuration of the GnuPG
  suite has completely moved to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, and ~/.gnupg/options
  is no longer in use.  Please rename the file if necessary, or move
  its contents to the new location.

gnupg2 (2.2.17-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Upstream GnuPG now defaults to not accepting third-party certifications
  from the keyserver network.  Given that the SKS keyserver network is
  under attack via certificate flooding, and third-party certifications
  will not be accepted anyway, we now ship with the more tightly-constrained
  and abuse-resistant system hkps://keys.openpgp.org as the default
  keyserver.

  Users with bandwidth to spare who want to try their luck with the SKS
  pool should add the following line to ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf to revert to
  upstream's default keyserver:

      keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net

  See the 2.2.17 section in the upstream NEWS file at
  /usr/share/doc/gnupg/NEWS.gz for more information about fully
  reverting to the old, risky behavior.

gnupg2 (2.1.11-7+exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  The gnupg package now provides the "modern" version of GnuPG.

  Please read /usr/share/doc/gnupg/README.Debian for details about the
  transition from "classic" to "modern"
