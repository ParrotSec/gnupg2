 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able

Description: GNU privacy guard - network certificate management service
 dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading OpenPGP and X.509
 certificates, as well as updates and status signals related to those
 certificates.  For OpenPGP, this means pulling from the public
 HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes
 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status
 Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using Tor for network
 access.

 dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,
 among other tools.  Unless this package is installed, the parts of
 the GnuPG suite that try to interact with the network will fail.

 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 This is GnuPG's signature verification tool, gpgv, built statically
 so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on
 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

 This package contains several useful utilities for manipulating
 OpenPGP data and other related cryptographic elements.  It includes:
 .
  * addgnupghome -- create .gnupg home directories
  * applygnupgdefaults -- run gpgconf --apply-defaults for all users
  * gpgcompose -- an experimental tool for constructing arbitrary
                  sequences of OpenPGP packets (e.g. for testing)
  * gpgparsemail -- parse an e-mail message into annotated format
  * gpgsplit -- split a sequence of OpenPGP packets into files
  * gpgtar -- encrypt or sign files in an archive
  * kbxutil -- list, export, import Keybox data
  * lspgpot -- convert PGP ownertrust values to GnuPG
  * migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg -- use only "modern" formats
  * symcryptrun -- use simple symmetric encryption tool in GnuPG framework
  * watchgnupg -- watch socket-based logs
