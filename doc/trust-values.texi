  @item e
  @itemx expired

  Trust calculation has failed; probably due to an expired key.

  @item q
  @itemx undefined, undef
  Not enough information for calculation.

  @item n
  @itemx never
  Never trust this key.

  @item m
  @itemx marginal
  Marginally trusted.

  @item f
  @itemx full
  Fully trusted.

  @item u
  @itemx ultimate
  Ultimately trusted.

  @item r
  @itemx revoked
  For validity only: the key or the user ID has been revoked.

  @item ?
  @itemx err
