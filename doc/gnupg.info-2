5.6.5 Generating a Key
----------------------

This is used to generate a new keypair, store the secret part in the PSE
and the public key in the key database.  We will probably add optional
commands to allow the client to select whether a hardware token is used
to store the key.  Configuration options to 'GPGSM' can be used to
restrict the use of this command.

       GENKEY

   'GPGSM' checks whether this command is allowed and then does an
INQUIRY to get the key parameters, the client should then send the key
parameters in the native format:

         S: INQUIRE KEY_PARAM native
         C: D foo:fgfgfg
         C: D bar
         C: END

   Please note that the server may send Status info lines while reading
the data lines from the client.  After this the key generation takes
place and the server eventually does send an ERR or OK response.  Status
lines may be issued as a progress indicator.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM LISTKEYS,  Next: GPGSM EXPORT,  Prev: GPGSM GENKEY,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.6 List available keys
-------------------------

To list the keys in the internal database or using an external key
provider, the command:

       LISTKEYS  PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed during the
search) quoting is required: Spaces are to be translated into "+" or
into "%20"; in turn this requires that the usual escape quoting rules
are done.

       LISTSECRETKEYS PATTERN

   Lists only the keys where a secret key is available.

   The list commands are affected by the option

       OPTION list-mode=MODE

   where mode may be:
'0'
     Use default (which is usually the same as 1).
'1'
     List only the internal keys.
'2'
     List only the external keys.
'3'
     List internal and external keys.

   Note that options are valid for the entire session.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM EXPORT,  Next: GPGSM IMPORT,  Prev: GPGSM LISTKEYS,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.7 Export certificates
-------------------------

To export certificate from the internal key database the command:

       EXPORT [--data [--armor] [--base64]] [--] PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed) quoting is
required: Spaces are to be translated into "+" or into "%20"; in turn
this requires that the usual escape quoting rules are done.

   If the '--data' option has not been given, the format of the output
depends on what was set with the 'OUTPUT' command.  When using PEM
encoding a few informational lines are prepended.

   If the '--data' has been given, a target set via 'OUTPUT' is ignored
and the data is returned inline using standard 'D'-lines.  This avoids
the need for an extra file descriptor.  In this case the options
'--armor' and '--base64' may be used in the same way as with the
'OUTPUT' command.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM IMPORT,  Next: GPGSM DELETE,  Prev: GPGSM EXPORT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.8 Import certificates
-------------------------

To import certificates into the internal key database, the command

       IMPORT [--re-import]

   is used.  The data is expected on the file descriptor set with the
'INPUT' command.  Certain checks are performed on the certificate.  Note
that the code will also handle PKCS#12 files and import private keys; a
helper program is used for that.

   With the option '--re-import' the input data is expected to a be a
linefeed separated list of fingerprints.  The command will re-import the
corresponding certificates; that is they are made permanent by removing
their ephemeral flag.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM DELETE,  Next: GPGSM GETAUDITLOG,  Prev: GPGSM IMPORT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.9 Delete certificates
-------------------------

To delete a certificate the command

       DELKEYS PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed) quoting is
required: Spaces are to be translated into "+" or into "%20"; in turn
this requires that the usual escape quoting rules are done.

   The certificates must be specified unambiguously otherwise an error
is returned.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM GETAUDITLOG,  Next: GPGSM GETINFO,  Prev: GPGSM DELETE,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.10 Retrieve an audit log
----------------------------

This command is used to retrieve an audit log.

     GETAUDITLOG [--data] [--html]

   If '--data' is used, the audit log is send using D-lines instead of
being sent to the file descriptor given by an 'OUTPUT' command.  If
'--html' is used, the output is formatted as an XHTML block.  This is
designed to be incorporated into a HTML document.

5.6.11 Return information about the process
-------------------------------------------

This is a multipurpose function to return a variety of information.

     GETINFO WHAT

   The value of WHAT specifies the kind of information returned:
'version'
     Return the version of the program.
'pid'
     Return the process id of the process.
'agent-check'
     Return OK if the agent is running.
'cmd_has_option CMD OPT'
     Return OK if the command CMD implements the option OPT.  The
     leading two dashes usually used with OPT shall not be given.
'offline'
     Return OK if the connection is in offline mode.  This may be either
     due to a 'OPTION offline=1' or due to 'gpgsm' being started with
     option '--disable-dirmngr'.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM OPTION,  Prev: GPGSM GETINFO,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.12 Session options
----------------------

The standard Assuan option handler supports these options.

     OPTION NAME[=VALUE]

   These NAMEs are recognized:

'putenv'
     Change the session's environment to be passed via gpg-agent to
     Pinentry.  VALUE is a string of the form '<KEY>[=[<STRING>]]'.  If
     only '<KEY>' is given the environment variable '<KEY>' is removed
     from the session environment, if '<KEY>=' is given that environment
     variable is set to the empty string, and if '<STRING>' is given it
     is set to that string.

'display'
     Set the session environment variable 'DISPLAY' is set to VALUE.
'ttyname'
     Set the session environment variable 'GPG_TTY' is set to VALUE.
'ttytype'
     Set the session environment variable 'TERM' is set to VALUE.
'lc-ctype'
     Set the session environment variable 'LC_CTYPE' is set to VALUE.
'lc-messages'
     Set the session environment variable 'LC_MESSAGES' is set to VALUE.
'xauthority'
     Set the session environment variable 'XAUTHORITY' is set to VALUE.
'pinentry-user-data'
     Set the session environment variable 'PINENTRY_USER_DATA' is set to
     VALUE.

'include-certs'
     This option overrides the command line option '--include-certs'.  A
     VALUE of -2 includes all certificates except for the root
     certificate, -1 includes all certificates, 0 does not include any
     certificates, 1 includes only the signers certificate and all other
     positive values include up to VALUE certificates starting with the
     signer cert.

'list-mode'
     *Note gpgsm-cmd listkeys::.

'list-to-output'
     If VALUE is true the output of the list commands (*note gpgsm-cmd
     listkeys::) is written to the file descriptor set with the last
     'OUTPUT' command.  If VALUE is false the output is written via data
     lines; this is the default.

'with-validation'
     If VALUE is true for each listed certificate the validation status
     is printed.  This may result in the download of a CRL or the user
     being asked about the trustworthiness of a root certificate.  The
     default is given by a command line option (*note gpgsm-option
     --with-validation::).

'with-secret'
     If VALUE is true certificates with a corresponding private key are
     marked by the list commands.

'validation-model'
     This option overrides the command line option 'validation-model'
     for the session.  (*Note gpgsm-option --validation-model::.)

'with-key-data'
     This option globally enables the command line option
     '--with-key-data'.  (*Note gpgsm-option --with-key-data::.)

'enable-audit-log'
     If VALUE is true data to write an audit log is gathered.  (*Note
     gpgsm-cmd getauditlog::.)

'allow-pinentry-notify'
     If this option is used notifications about the launch of a Pinentry
     are passed back to the client.

'with-ephemeral-keys'
     If VALUE is true ephemeral certificates are included in the output
     of the list commands.

'no-encrypt-to'
     If this option is used all keys set by the command line option
     '--encrypt-to' are ignored.

'offline'
     If VALUE is true or VALUE is not given all network access is
     disabled for this session.  This is the same as the command line
     option '--disable-dirmngr'.

6.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

'--version'
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

'--help, -h'
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

'--dump-options'
     Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

'--server'
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the 'stdin'.  The
     default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.

'--multi-server'
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the 'stdin' as well as
     on an additional Unix Domain socket.  The server command 'GETINFO'
     may be used to get the name of that extra socket.

'--daemon'
     Run the program in the background.  This option is required to
     prevent it from being accidentally running in the background.

6.2 Option Summary
==================

'--options FILE'
     Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default per-user
     configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
     'scdaemon.conf' and expected in the '.gnupg' directory directly
     below the home directory of the user.

'--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME'
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

     To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
     empty file named 'gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the tool
     'gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is then that
     directory; or, if 'gpgconf.exe' has been installed directly below a
     directory named 'bin', its parent directory.  You also need to make
     sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
     'ROOT/home' for the GnuPG home and 'ROOT/usr/local/var/cache/gnupg'
     for internal cache files.

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to 'gpgsm', such as
     '-vv'.

'--debug-level LEVEL'
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or a keyword:

     'none'
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     'basic'
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     'advanced'
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     'expert'
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     'guru'
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

          Note: All debugging options are subject to change and thus
          should not be used by any application program.  As the name
          says, they are only used as helpers to debug problems.

'--debug FLAGS'
     This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior may
     change at any time without notice.  FLAGS are bit encoded and may
     be given in usual C-Syntax.  The currently defined bits are:

     '0 (1)'
          command I/O
     '1 (2)'
          values of big number integers
     '2 (4)'
          low level crypto operations
     '5 (32)'
          memory allocation
     '6 (64)'
          caching
     '7 (128)'
          show memory statistics
     '9 (512)'
          write hashed data to files named 'dbgmd-000*'
     '10 (1024)'
          trace Assuan protocol.  See also option
          '--debug-assuan-log-cats'.
     '11 (2048)'
          trace APDU I/O to the card.  This may reveal sensitive data.
     '12 (4096)'
          trace some card reader related function calls.

'--debug-all'
     Same as '--debug=0xffffffff'

'--debug-wait N'
     When running in server mode, wait N seconds before entering the
     actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives time to
     attach a debugger.

'--debug-ccid-driver'
     Enable debug output from the included CCID driver for smartcards.
     Using this option twice will also enable some tracing of the T=1
     protocol.  Note that this option may reveal sensitive data.

'--debug-disable-ticker'
     This option disables all ticker functions like checking for card
     insertions.

'--debug-allow-core-dump'
     For security reasons we won't create a core dump when the process
     aborts.  For debugging purposes it is sometimes better to allow
     core dump.  This option enables it and also changes the working
     directory to '/tmp' when running in '--server' mode.

'--debug-log-tid'
     This option appends a thread ID to the PID in the log output.

'--debug-assuan-log-cats CATS'
     Changes the active Libassuan logging categories to CATS.  The value
     for CATS is an unsigned integer given in usual C-Syntax.  A value
     of 0 switches to a default category.  If this option is not used
     the categories are taken from the environment variable
     'ASSUAN_DEBUG'.  Note that this option has only an effect if the
     Assuan debug flag has also been with the option '--debug'.  For a
     list of categories see the Libassuan manual.

'--no-detach'
     Don't detach the process from the console.  This is mainly useful
     for debugging.

'--listen-backlog N'
     Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is
     64.  This option has an effect only if '--multi-server' is also
     used.

'--log-file FILE'
     Append all logging output to FILE.  This is very helpful in seeing
     what the agent actually does.  Use 'socket://' to log to socket.

'--pcsc-driver LIBRARY'
     Use LIBRARY to access the smartcard reader.  The current default is
     'libpcsclite.so'.  Instead of using this option you might also want
     to install a symbolic link to the default file name (e.g.  from
     'libpcsclite.so.1').

'--ctapi-driver LIBRARY'
     Use LIBRARY to access the smartcard reader.  The current default is
     'libtowitoko.so'.  Note that the use of this interface is
     deprecated; it may be removed in future releases.

'--disable-ccid'
     Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers.  This
     allows falling back to one of the other drivers even if the
     internal CCID driver can handle the reader.  Note, that CCID
     support is only available if libusb was available at build time.

'--reader-port NUMBER_OR_STRING'
     This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal.
     A value of 0 refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access
     USB devices.  The default is 32768 (first USB device).  PC/SC or
     CCID readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose
     mode to get a list of available readers.  The default is then the
     first reader found.

     To get a list of available CCID readers you may use this command:
            echo scd getinfo reader_list \
              | gpg-connect-agent --decode | awk '/^D/ {print $2}'

'--card-timeout N'
     If N is not 0 and no client is actively using the card, the card
     will be powered down after N seconds.  Powering down the card
     avoids a potential risk of damaging a card when used with certain
     cheap readers.  This also allows applications that are not aware of
     Scdaemon to access the card.  The disadvantage of using a card
     timeout is that accessing the card takes longer and that the user
     needs to enter the PIN again after the next power up.

     Note that with the current version of Scdaemon the card is powered
     down immediately at the next timer tick for any value of N other
     than 0.

'--enable-pinpad-varlen'
     Please specify this option when the card reader supports variable
     length input for pinpad (default is no).  For known readers (listed
     in ccid-driver.c and apdu.c), this option is not needed.  Note that
     if your card reader doesn't supports variable length input but you
     want to use it, you need to specify your pinpad request on your
     card.

'--disable-pinpad'
     Even if a card reader features a pinpad, do not try to use it.

'--deny-admin'
     This option disables the use of admin class commands for card
     applications where this is supported.  Currently we support it for
     the OpenPGP card.  This option is useful to inhibit accidental
     access to admin class command which could ultimately lock the card
     through wrong PIN numbers.  Note that GnuPG versions older than
     2.0.11 featured an '--allow-admin' option which was required to use
     such admin commands.  This option has no more effect today because
     the default is now to allow admin commands.

'--disable-application NAME'
     This option disables the use of the card application named NAME.
     This is mainly useful for debugging or if a application with lower
     priority should be used by default.

   All the long options may also be given in the configuration file
after stripping off the two leading dashes.

6.4 Configuration files
=======================

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
'scdaemons''s operation.  Unless noted, they are expected in the current
home directory (*note option --homedir::).

'scdaemon.conf'
     This is the standard configuration file read by 'scdaemon' on
     startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two
     dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
     This default name may be changed on the command line (*note option
     --options::).

'scd-event'
     If this file is present and executable, it will be called on every

6.6 Scdaemon's Assuan Protocol
==============================

The SC-Daemon should be started by the system to provide access to
external tokens.  Using Smartcards on a multi-user system does not make
much sense except for system services, but in this case no regular user
accounts are hosted on the machine.

   A client connects to the SC-Daemon by connecting to the socket named
'/usr/local/var/run/gnupg/scdaemon/socket', configuration information is
read from /ETC/GNUPG/SCDAEMON.CONF

   Each connection acts as one session, SC-Daemon takes care of
synchronizing access to a token between sessions.

6.6.1 Return the serial number
------------------------------

This command should be used to check for the presence of a card.  It is
special in that it can be used to reset the card.  Most other commands
will return an error when a card change has been detected and the use of
this function is therefore required.

   Background: We want to keep the client clear of handling card changes
between operations; i.e.  the client can assume that all operations are
done on the same card unless he call this function.

       SERIALNO

   Return the serial number of the card using a status response like:

       S SERIALNO D27600000000000000000000

   The serial number is the hex encoded value identified by the '0x5A'
tag in the GDO file (FIX=0x2F02).

6.6.2 Read all useful information from the card
-----------------------------------------------

       LEARN [--force]

   Learn all useful information of the currently inserted card.  When
used without the '--force' option, the command might do an INQUIRE like
this:

           INQUIRE KNOWNCARDP <hexstring_with_serialNumber>

   The client should just send an 'END' if the processing should go on
or a 'CANCEL' to force the function to terminate with a cancel error
message.  The response of this command is a list of status lines
formatted as this:

          S KEYPAIRINFO HEXSTRING_WITH_KEYGRIP HEXSTRING_WITH_ID

   If there is no certificate yet stored on the card a single "X" is
returned in HEXSTRING_WITH_KEYGRIP.

6.6.3 Return a certificate
--------------------------

      READCERT HEXIFIED_CERTID|KEYID

   This function is used to read a certificate identified by
HEXIFIED_CERTID from the card.  With OpenPGP cards the keyid 'OpenPGP.3'
may be used to read the certificate of version 2 cards.

6.6.5 Signing data with a Smartcard
-----------------------------------

To sign some data the caller should use the command

      SETDATA HEXSTRING

   to tell 'scdaemon' about the data to be signed.  The data must be
given in hex notation.  The actual signing is done using the command

       PKSIGN KEYID

   where KEYID is the hexified ID of the key to be used.  The key id may
have been retrieved using the command 'LEARN'.  If another hash
algorithm than SHA-1 is used, that algorithm may be given like:

       PKSIGN --hash=ALGONAME KEYID

   With ALGONAME are one of 'sha1', 'rmd160' or 'md5'.

6.6.6 Decrypting data with a Smartcard
--------------------------------------

To decrypt some data the caller should use the command

      SETDATA HEXSTRING

   to tell 'scdaemon' about the data to be decrypted.  The data must be
given in hex notation.  The actual decryption is then done using the
command

       PKDECRYPT KEYID

   where KEYID is the hexified ID of the key to be used.

   If the card is aware of the apdding format a status line with padding
information is send before the plaintext data.  The key for this status
line is 'PADDING' with the only defined value being 0 and meaning
padding has been removed.

---------------------------

       WRITEKEY [--force] KEYID

   This command is used to store a secret key on a smartcard.  The
allowed keyids depend on the currently selected smartcard application.
The actual keydata is requested using the inquiry 'KEYDATA' and need to
be provided without any protection.  With '--force' set an existing key
under this KEYID will get overwritten.  The key data is expected to be
the usual canonical encoded S-expression.

   A PIN will be requested in most cases.  This however depends on the
actual card application.

------------------

        PASSWD [--reset] [--nullpin] CHVNO

verification vector number CHVNO.  The option '--nullpin' is used to
initialize the PIN of TCOS cards (6 byte NullPIN only).

6.6.13 Perform a VERIFY operation
---------------------------------

       CHECKPIN IDSTR

   Perform a VERIFY operation without doing anything else.  This may be
used to initialize a the PIN cache earlier to long lasting operations.
Its use is highly application dependent:

*OpenPGP*

     Perform a simple verify operation for CHV1 and CHV2, so that
     further operations won't ask for CHV2 and it is possible to do a
     cheap check on the PIN: If there is something wrong with the PIN
     entry system, only the regular CHV will get blocked and not the
     dangerous CHV3.  IDSTR is the usual card's serial number in hex
     notation; an optional fingerprint part will get ignored.

     There is however a special mode if IDSTR is suffixed with the
     literal string '[CHV3]': In this case the Admin PIN is checked if
     and only if the retry counter is still at 3.

6.6.14 Perform a RESTART operation
----------------------------------

       RESTART

   Restart the current connection; this is a kind of warm reset.  It
deletes the context used by this connection but does not actually reset
the card.

   This is used by gpg-agent to reuse a primary pipe connection and may
be used by clients to backup from a conflict in the serial command; i.e.
to select another application.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon APDU,  Prev: Scdaemon RESTART,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.15 Send a verbatim APDU to the card
---------------------------------------

       APDU [--atr] [--more] [--exlen[=N]] [HEXSTRING]

   Send an APDU to the current reader.  This command bypasses the high
level functions and sends the data directly to the card.  HEXSTRING is
expected to be a proper APDU. If HEXSTRING is not given no commands are
send to the card; However the command will implicitly check whether the
card is ready for use.

   Using the option '--atr' returns the ATR of the card as a status
message before any data like this:
          S CARD-ATR 3BFA1300FF813180450031C173C00100009000B1

   Using the option '--more' handles the card status word MORE_DATA
(61xx) and concatenate all responses to one block.

   Using the option '--exlen' the returned APDU may use extended length
up to N bytes.  If N is not given a default value is used (currently
4096).

7 How to Specify a User Id
**************************

There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them are
only valid for 'gpg' others are only good for 'gpgsm'.  Here is the
entire list of ways to specify a key:

   * By key Id.  This format is deduced from the length of the string
     and its content or '0x' prefix.  The key Id of an X.509 certificate
     are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids
     is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint
     should be used.

     When using 'gpg' an exclamation mark (!)  may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long
     form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol.  You can see the
     long key ID using the option '--with-colons'.

          234567C4
          0F34E556E
          01347A56A
          0xAB123456

          234AABBCC34567C4
          0F323456784E56EAB
          01AB3FED1347A5612
          0x234AABBCC34567C4

   * By fingerprint.  This format is deduced from the length of the
     string and its content or the '0x' prefix.  Note, that only the 20
     byte version fingerprint is available with 'gpgsm' (i.e.  the SHA-1
     hash of the certificate).

     When using 'gpg' an exclamation mark (!)  may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint.  This
     avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.

          1234343434343434C434343434343434
          123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
          0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
          0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434

     'gpgsm' also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal digits
     because this is the de-facto standard on how to present X.509
     fingerprints.  'gpg' also allows the use of the space separated
     SHA-1 fingerprint as printed by the key listing commands.

   * By exact match on OpenPGP user ID. This is denoted by a leading
     equal sign.  It does not make sense for X.509 certificates.

          =Heinrich Heine <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>

   * By exact match on an email address.  This is indicated by enclosing
     the email address in the usual way with left and right angles.

          <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>

   * By partial match on an email address.  This is indicated by
     prefixing the search string with an '@'.  This uses a substring
     search but considers only the mail address (i.e.  inside the angle
     brackets).

          @heinrichh

   * By exact match on the subject's DN. This is indicated by a leading
     slash, directly followed by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the subject.
     Note that you can't use the string printed by 'gpgsm --list-keys'
     because that one has been reordered and modified for better
     readability; use '--with-colons' to print the raw (but standard
     escaped) RFC-2253 string.

          /CN=Heinrich Heine,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By exact match on the issuer's DN. This is indicated by a leading
     hash mark, directly followed by a slash and then directly followed
     by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer.  This should return the
     Root cert of the issuer.  See note above.

          #/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By exact match on serial number and issuer's DN. This is indicated
     by a hash mark, followed by the hexadecimal representation of the
     serial number, then followed by a slash and the RFC-2253 encoded DN
     of the issuer.  See note above.

          #4F03/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   * By keygrip.  This is indicated by an ampersand followed by the 40
     hex digits of a keygrip.  'gpgsm' prints the keygrip when using the
     command '--dump-cert'.

          &D75F22C3F86E355877348498CDC92BD21010A480

   * By substring match.  This is the default mode but applications may
     want to explicitly indicate this by putting the asterisk in front.
     Match is not case sensitive.

          Heine
          *Heine

   * .  and + prefixes These prefixes are reserved for looking up mails
     anchored at the end and for a word search mode.  They are not yet
     implemented and using them is undefined.

   Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was
used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id.  It is
not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509
stuff.

   Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don't
have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta
data.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: watchgnupg,  Next: gpgv,  Up: Helper Tools

9.1 Read logs from a socket
===========================

Most of the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix
Domain socket if configured that way.  'watchgnupg' is a simple listener
for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and
makes sure that long lines are not interspersed with log output from
other utilities.  This tool is not available for Windows.

'watchgnupg' is commonly invoked as

     watchgnupg --force $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

This starts it on the current terminal for listening on the standard
logging socket (which is either '~/.gnupg/S.log' or
'/var/run/user/UID/gnupg/S.log').

'watchgnupg' understands these options:

'--force'
     Delete an already existing socket file.

'--tcp N'
     Instead of reading from a local socket, listen for connects on TCP
     port N.

'--time-only'
     Do not print the date part of the timestamp.

'--verbose'
     Enable extra informational output.

'--version'
     Print version of the program and exit.

'--help'
     Display a brief help page and exit.


Examples
********

     $ watchgnupg --force --time-only $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

   This waits for connections on the local socket (e.g.
'/home/foo/.gnupg/S.log') and shows all log entries.  To make this work
the option 'log-file' needs to be used with all modules which logs are
to be shown.  The suggested entry for the configuration files is:

     log-file socket://

   If the default socket as given above and returned by "echo $(gpgconf
-list-dirs socketdir)/S.log" is not desired an arbitrary socket name can
be specified, for example 'socket:///home/foo/bar/mysocket'.  For
debugging purposes it is also possible to do remote logging.  Take care
if you use this feature because the information is send in the clear
over the network.  Use this syntax in the conf files:

     log-file tcp://192.168.1.1:4711

   You may use any port and not just 4711 as shown above; only IP
addresses are supported (v4 and v6) and no host names.  You need to
start 'watchgnupg' with the 'tcp' option.  Note that under Windows the
registry entry HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:DEFAULTLOGFILE can be used to
change the default log output from 'stderr' to whatever is given by that
entry.  However the only useful entry is a TCP name for remote
debugging.

9.2 Verify OpenPGP signatures
=============================

'gpgv' is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

   This program is actually a stripped-down version of 'gpg' which is
only able to check signatures.  It is somewhat smaller than the
fully-blown 'gpg' and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that
the public keys used to make the signature are valid.  There are no
configuration files and only a few options are implemented.

   'gpgv' assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That
does also mean that it does not check for expired or revoked keys.

   If no '--keyring' option is given, 'gpgv' looks for a "default"
keyring named 'trustedkeys.kbx' (preferred) or 'trustedkeys.gpg' in the
home directory of GnuPG, either the default home directory or the one
set by the '--homedir' option or the 'GNUPGHOME' environment variable.
If any '--keyring' option is used, 'gpgv' will not look for the default
keyring.  The '--keyring' option may be used multiple times and all
specified keyrings will be used together.


   'gpgv' recognizes these options:

'--verbose'
'-v'
     Gives more information during processing.  If used twice, the input
     data is listed in detail.

'--quiet'
'-q'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

'--keyring FILE'
     Add FILE to the list of keyrings.  If FILE begins with a tilde and
     a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory.  If the filename
     does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the home-directory
     ("~/.gnupg" if -homedir is not used).

'--output FILE'
'-o FILE'
     Write output to FILE; to write to stdout use '-'.  This option can
     be used to get the signed text from a cleartext or binary
     signature; it also works for detached signatures, but in that case
     this option is in general not useful.  Note that an existing file
     will be overwritten.

'--status-fd N'
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

'--logger-fd n'
     Write log output to file descriptor 'n' and not to stderr.

'--log-file file'
     Same as '--logger-fd', except the logger data is written to file
     'file'.  Use 'socket://' to log to socket.

'--ignore-time-conflict'
     GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
     signatures have plausible values.  However, sometimes a signature
     seems to be older than the key due to clock problems.  This option
     turns these checks into warnings.

'--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME'
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

     To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
     empty file named 'gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the tool
     'gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is then that
     directory; or, if 'gpgconf.exe' has been installed directly below a
     directory named 'bin', its parent directory.  You also need to make
     sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
     'ROOT/home' for the GnuPG home and 'ROOT/usr/local/var/cache/gnupg'
     for internal cache files.

'--weak-digest name'
     Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over
     weak digests algorithms are normally rejected.  This option can be
     supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be considered
     weak.  MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to be
     listed explicitly.

'--enable-special-filenames'
     This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form '-&n',
     where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file
     descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

   The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least one
signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

9.2.1 Examples
--------------

gpgv 'pgpfile'
gpgv 'sigfile' ['datafile']
     Verify the signature of the file.  The second form is used for
     detached signatures, where 'sigfile' is the detached signature
     (either ASCII-armored or binary) and 'datafile' contains the signed
     data; if 'datafile' is "-" the signed data is expected on 'stdin';
     if 'datafile' is not given the name of the file holding the signed
     data is constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc", ".sig" or
     ".sign") from 'sigfile'.

9.2.2 Environment

9.3 Create .gnupg home directories
==================================

If GnuPG is installed on a system with existing user accounts, it is
sometimes required to populate the GnuPG home directory with existing
files.  Especially a 'trustlist.txt' and a keybox with some initial
certificates are often desired.  This script helps to do this by copying
all files from '/etc/skel/.gnupg' to the home directories of the
accounts given on the command line.  It takes care not to overwrite
existing GnuPG home directories.

'addgnupghome' is invoked by root as:

     addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn

9.4 Modify .gnupg home directories
==================================

The 'gpgconf' is a utility to automatically and reasonable safely query
and modify configuration files in the '.gnupg' home directory.  It is
designed not to be invoked manually by the user, but automatically by
graphical user interfaces (GUI).(1)

   'gpgconf' provides access to the configuration of one or more
components of the GnuPG system.  These components correspond more or
less to the programs that exist in the GnuPG framework, like GPG, GPGSM,
DirMngr, etc.  But this is not a strict one-to-one relationship.  Not
all configuration options are available through 'gpgconf'.  'gpgconf'
provides a generic and abstract method to access the most important
configuration options that can feasibly be controlled via such a
mechanism.

   'gpgconf' can be used to gather and change the options available in
each component, and can also provide their default values.  'gpgconf'
will give detailed type information that can be used to restrict the
user's input without making an attempt to commit the changes.

   'gpgconf' provides the backend of a configuration editor.  The
configuration editor would usually be a graphical user interface program
that displays the current options, their default values, and allows the
user to make changes to the options.  These changes can then be made
active with 'gpgconf' again.  Such a program that uses 'gpgconf' in this
way will be called GUI throughout this section.

some changes may get lost.  The stateless design makes it difficult to
provide more guarantees.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpgconf,  Next: Format conventions,  Up: gpgconf

9.4.1 Invoking gpgconf
----------------------

One of the following commands must be given:

'--list-components'
     List all components.  This is the default command used if none is
     specified.

'--check-programs'
     List all available backend programs and test whether they are
     runnable.

'--list-options COMPONENT'
     List all options of the component COMPONENT.

'--change-options COMPONENT'
     Change the options of the component COMPONENT.

'--check-options COMPONENT'
     Check the options for the component COMPONENT.

'--apply-profile FILE'
     Apply the configuration settings listed in FILE to the
     configuration files.  If FILE has no suffix and no slashes the
     command first tries to read a file with the suffix '.prf' from the
     data directory ('gpgconf --list-dirs datadir') before it reads the
     file verbatim.  A profile is divided into sections using the
     bracketed component name.  Each section then lists the option which
     shall go into the respective configuration file.

'--apply-defaults'
     Update all configuration files with values taken from the global
     configuration file (usually '/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf').

'--list-dirs [NAMES]'
     Lists the directories used by 'gpgconf'.  One directory is listed
     per line, and each line consists of a colon-separated list where
     the first field names the directory type (for example 'sysconfdir')
     and the second field contains the percent-escaped directory.
     Although they are not directories, the socket file names used by
     'gpg-agent' and 'dirmngr' are printed as well.  Note that the
     socket file names and the 'homedir' lines are the default names and
     they may be overridden by command line switches.  If NAMES are
     given only the directories or file names specified by the list
     names are printed without any escaping.

'--list-config [FILENAME]'
     List the global configuration file in a colon separated format.  If
     FILENAME is given, check that file instead.

'--check-config [FILENAME]'
     Run a syntax check on the global configuration file.  If FILENAME
     is given, check that file instead.

'--query-swdb PACKAGE_NAME [VERSION_STRING]'
     Returns the current version for PACKAGE_NAME and if VERSION_STRING
     is given also an indicator on whether an update is available.  The
     actual file with the software version is automatically downloaded
     and checked by 'dirmngr'.  'dirmngr' uses a thresholds to avoid
     download the file too often and it does this by default only if it
     can be done via Tor.  To force an update of that file this command
     can be used:

                 gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'loadswdb --force' /bye

'--reload [COMPONENT]'
     Reload all or the given component.  This is basically the same as
     sending a SIGHUP to the component.  Components which don't support
     reloading are ignored.  Without COMPONENT or by using "all" for
     COMPONENT all components which are daemons are reloaded.

'--launch [COMPONENT]'
     If the COMPONENT is not already running, start it.  'component'
     must be a daemon.  This is in general not required because the
     system starts these daemons as needed.  However, external software
     making direct use of 'gpg-agent' or 'dirmngr' may use this command
     to ensure that they are started.  Using "all" for COMPONENT
     launches all components which are daemons.

'--kill [COMPONENT]'
     Kill the given component that runs as a daemon, including
     'gpg-agent', 'dirmngr', and 'scdaemon'.  A 'component' which does
     not run as a daemon will be ignored.  Using "all" for COMPONENT
     kills all components running as daemons.  Note that as of now
     reload and kill have the same effect for 'scdaemon'.

'--create-socketdir'
     Create a directory for sockets below /run/user or /var/run/user.
     This is command is only required if a non default home directory is
     used and the /run based sockets shall be used.  For the default
     home directory GnUPG creates a directory on the fly.

'--remove-socketdir'
     Remove a directory created with command '--create-socketdir'.

   The following options may be used:

'-o FILE'
'--output FILE'
     Write output to FILE.  Default is to write to stdout.

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Outputs additional information while running.  Specifically, this
     extends numerical field values by human-readable descriptions.

'-q'
'--quiet'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

'--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME'
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

     To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
     empty file named 'gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the tool
     'gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is then that
     directory; or, if 'gpgconf.exe' has been installed directly below a
     directory named 'bin', its parent directory.  You also need to make
     sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
     'ROOT/home' for the GnuPG home and 'ROOT/usr/local/var/cache/gnupg'
     for internal cache files.

'-n'
'--dry-run'
     Do not actually change anything.  This is currently only
     implemented for '--change-options' and can be used for testing
     purposes.

'-r'
'--runtime'
     Only used together with '--change-options'.  If one of the modified
     options can be changed in a running daemon process, signal the
     running daemon to ask it to reparse its configuration file after
     changing.

     This means that the changes will take effect at run-time, as far as
     this is possible.  Otherwise, they will take effect at the next
     start of the respective backend programs.

'--status-fd N'
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  This
     program returns the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which are
     helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can't
     easily get the return code of the process.

9.4.2 Format conventions
------------------------

Some lines in the output of 'gpgconf' contain a list of colon-separated
fields.  The following conventions apply:

   * The GUI program is required to strip off trailing newline and/or
     carriage return characters from the output.

   * 'gpgconf' will never leave out fields.  If a certain version
     provides a certain field, this field will always be present in all
     'gpgconf' versions from that time on.

   * Future versions of 'gpgconf' might append fields to the list.  New
     fields will always be separated from the previously last field by a
     colon separator.  The GUI should be prepared to parse the last
     field it knows about up until a colon or end of line.

   * Not all fields are defined under all conditions.  You are required
     to ignore the content of undefined fields.

   There are several standard types for the content of a field:

verbatim
     Some fields contain strings that are not escaped in any way.  Such
     fields are described to be used _verbatim_.  These fields will
     never contain a colon character (for obvious reasons).  No
     de-escaping or other formatting is required to use the field
     content.  This is for easy parsing of the output, when it is known
     that the content can never contain any special characters.

percent-escaped
     Some fields contain strings that are described to be
     _percent-escaped_.  Such strings need to be de-escaped before their
     content can be presented to the user.  A percent-escaped string is
     de-escaped by replacing all occurrences of '%XY' by the byte that
     has the hexadecimal value 'XY'.  'X' and 'Y' are from the set
     '0-9a-f'.

localized
     Some fields contain strings that are described to be _localized_.
     Such strings are translated to the active language and formatted in
     the active character set.

unsigned number
     Some fields contain an _unsigned number_.  This number will always
     fit into a 32-bit unsigned integer variable.  The number may be
     followed by a space, followed by a human readable description of
     that value (if the verbose option is used).  You should ignore
     everything in the field that follows the number.

signed number
     Some fields contain a _signed number_.  This number will always fit
     into a 32-bit signed integer variable.  The number may be followed
     by a space, followed by a human readable description of that value
     (if the verbose option is used).  You should ignore everything in
     the field that follows the number.

boolean value
     Some fields contain a _boolean value_.  This is a number with
     either the value 0 or 1.  The number may be followed by a space,
     followed by a human readable description of that value (if the
     verbose option is used).  You should ignore everything in the field
     that follows the number; checking just the first character is
     sufficient in this case.

option
     Some fields contain an _option_ argument.  The format of an option
     argument depends on the type of the option and on some flags:

     no argument
          The simplest case is that the option does not take an argument
          at all (TYPE '0').  Then the option argument is an unsigned
          number that specifies how often the option occurs.  If the
          'list' flag is not set, then the only valid number is '1'.
          Options that do not take an argument never have the 'default'
          or 'optional arg' flag set.

     number
          If the option takes a number argument (ALT-TYPE is '2' or
          '3'), and it can only occur once ('list' flag is not set),
          then the option argument is either empty (only allowed if the
          argument is optional), or it is a number.  A number is a
          string that begins with an optional minus character, followed
          by one or more digits.  The number must fit into an integer
          variable (unsigned or signed, depending on ALT-TYPE).

     number list
          If the option takes a number argument and it can occur more
          than once, then the option argument is either empty, or it is
          a comma-separated list of numbers as described above.

     string
          If the option takes a string argument (ALT-TYPE is 1), and it
          can only occur once ('list' flag is not set) then the option
          argument is either empty (only allowed if the argument is
          optional), or it starts with a double quote character ('"')
          followed by a percent-escaped string that is the argument
          value.  Note that there is only a leading double quote
          character, no trailing one.  The double quote character is
          only needed to be able to differentiate between no value and
          the empty string as value.

     string list
          If the option takes a string argument and it can occur more
          than once, then the option argument is either empty, or it is
          a comma-separated list of string arguments as described above.

   The active language and character set are currently determined from
the locale environment of the 'gpgconf' program.

9.4.3 Listing components
------------------------

The command '--list-components' will list all components that can be
configured with 'gpgconf'.  Usually, one component will correspond to
one GnuPG-related program and contain the options of that program's
configuration file that can be modified using 'gpgconf'.  However, this
is not necessarily the case.  A component might also be a group of
selected options from several programs, or contain entirely virtual
options that have a special effect rather than changing exactly one
option in one configuration file.

   A component is a set of configuration options that semantically
belong together.  Furthermore, several changes to a component can be
made in an atomic way with a single operation.  The GUI could for
example provide a menu with one entry for each component, or a window
with one tabulator sheet per component.

   The command '--list-components' lists all available components, one
per line.  The format of each line is:

   'NAME:DESCRIPTION:PGMNAME:'

NAME
     This field contains a name tag of the component.  The name tag is
     used to specify the component in all communication with 'gpgconf'.
     The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.  It is thus not in any
     escaped format.

DESCRIPTION
     The _string_ in this field contains a human-readable description of
     the component.  It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for
     informational purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

PGMNAME
     The _string_ in this field contains the absolute name of the
     program's file.  It can be used to unambiguously invoke that
     program.  It is _percent-escaped_.

   Example:
     $ gpgconf --list-components
     gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:
     gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:
     scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:
     gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:
     dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Checking programs,  Next: Listing options,  Prev: Listing components,  Up: gpgconf

9.4.4 Checking programs
-----------------------

The command '--check-programs' is similar to '--list-components' but
works on backend programs and not on components.  It runs each program
to test whether it is installed and runnable.  This also includes a
syntax check of all config file options of the program.

   The command '--check-programs' lists all available programs, one per
line.  The format of each line is:

   'NAME:DESCRIPTION:PGMNAME:AVAIL:OKAY:CFGFILE:LINE:ERROR:'

NAME
     This field contains a name tag of the program which is identical to
     the name of the component.  The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.
     It is thus not in any escaped format.  This field may be empty to
     indicate a continuation of error descriptions for the last name.
     The description and pgmname fields are then also empty.

DESCRIPTION
     The _string_ in this field contains a human-readable description of
     the component.  It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for
     informational purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

PGMNAME
     The _string_ in this field contains the absolute name of the
     program's file.  It can be used to unambiguously invoke that
     program.  It is _percent-escaped_.

AVAIL
     The _boolean value_ in this field indicates whether the program is
     installed and runnable.

OKAY
     The _boolean value_ in this field indicates whether the program's
     config file is syntactically okay.

CFGFILE
     If an error occurred in the configuration file (as indicated by a
     false value in the field 'okay'), this field has the name of the
     failing configuration file.  It is _percent-escaped_.

LINE
     If an error occurred in the configuration file, this field has the
     line number of the failing statement in the configuration file.  It
     is an _unsigned number_.

ERROR
     If an error occurred in the configuration file, this field has the
     error text of the failing statement in the configuration file.  It
     is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

In the following example the 'dirmngr' is not runnable and the
configuration file of 'scdaemon' is not okay.

     $ gpgconf --check-programs
     gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:1:1:
     gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:1:1:
     scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:1:0:
     gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:1:1:
     dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:0:0:

The command '--check-options COMPONENT' will verify the configuration
file in the same manner as '--check-programs', but only for the
component COMPONENT.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Listing options,  Next: Changing options,  Prev: Checking programs,  Up: gpgconf

9.4.5 Listing options
---------------------

Every component contains one or more options.  Options may be gathered
into option groups to allow the GUI to give visual hints to the user
about which options are related.

   The command '--list-options COMPONENT' lists all options (and the
groups they belong to) in the component COMPONENT, one per line.
COMPONENT must be the string in the field NAME in the output of the
'--list-components' command.

   There is one line for each option and each group.  First come all
options that are not in any group.  Then comes a line describing a
group.  Then come all options that belong into each group.  Then comes
the next group and so on.  There does not need to be any group (and in
this case the output will stop after the last non-grouped option).

   The format of each line is:

   'NAME:FLAGS:LEVEL:DESCRIPTION:TYPE:ALT-TYPE:ARGNAME:DEFAULT:ARGDEF:VALUE'

NAME
     This field contains a name tag for the group or option.  The name
     tag is used to specify the group or option in all communication
     with 'gpgconf'.  The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.  It is thus
     not in any escaped format.

FLAGS
     The flags field contains an _unsigned number_.  Its value is the
     OR-wise combination of the following flag values:

     'group (1)'
          If this flag is set, this is a line describing a group and not
          an option.

     The following flag values are only defined for options (that is, if
     the 'group' flag is not used).

     'optional arg (2)'
          If this flag is set, the argument is optional.  This is never
          set for TYPE '0' (none) options.

     'list (4)'
          If this flag is set, the option can be given multiple times.

     'runtime (8)'
          If this flag is set, the option can be changed at runtime.

     'default (16)'
          If this flag is set, a default value is available.

     'default desc (32)'
          If this flag is set, a (runtime) default is available.  This
          and the 'default' flag are mutually exclusive.

     'no arg desc (64)'
          If this flag is set, and the 'optional arg' flag is set, then
          the option has a special meaning if no argument is given.

     'no change (128)'
          If this flag is set, 'gpgconf' ignores requests to change the
          value.  GUI frontends should grey out this option.  Note, that
          manual changes of the configuration files are still possible.

LEVEL
     This field is defined for options and for groups.  It contains an
     _unsigned number_ that specifies the expert level under which this
     group or option should be displayed.  The following expert levels
     are defined for options (they have analogous meaning for groups):

     'basic (0)'
          This option should always be offered to the user.

     'advanced (1)'
          This option may be offered to advanced users.

     'expert (2)'
          This option should only be offered to expert users.

     'invisible (3)'
          This option should normally never be displayed, not even to
          expert users.

     'internal (4)'
          This option is for internal use only.  Ignore it.

     The level of a group will always be the lowest level of all options
     it contains.

DESCRIPTION
     This field is defined for options and groups.  The _string_ in this
     field contains a human-readable description of the option or group.
     It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for informational
     purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

TYPE
     This field is only defined for options.  It contains an _unsigned
     number_ that specifies the type of the option's argument, if any.
     The following types are defined:

     Basic types:

     'none (0)'
          No argument allowed.

     'string (1)'
          An _unformatted string_.

     'int32 (2)'
          A _signed number_.

     'uint32 (3)'
          An _unsigned number_.

     Complex types:

     'pathname (32)'
          A _string_ that describes the pathname of a file.  The file
          does not necessarily need to exist.

     'ldap server (33)'
          A _string_ that describes an LDAP server in the format:

          'HOSTNAME:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD:BASE_DN'

     'key fingerprint (34)'
          A _string_ with a 40 digit fingerprint specifying a
          certificate.

     'pub key (35)'
          A _string_ that describes a certificate by user ID, key ID or
          fingerprint.

     'sec key (36)'
          A _string_ that describes a certificate with a key by user ID,
          key ID or fingerprint.

     'alias list (37)'
          A _string_ that describes an alias list, like the one used
          with gpg's group option.  The list consists of a key, an equal
          sign and space separated values.

     More types will be added in the future.  Please see the ALT-TYPE
     field for information on how to cope with unknown types.

ALT-TYPE
     This field is identical to TYPE, except that only the types '0' to
     '31' are allowed.  The GUI is expected to present the user the
     option in the format specified by TYPE.  But if the argument type
     TYPE is not supported by the GUI, it can still display the option
     in the more generic basic type ALT-TYPE.  The GUI must support all
     the defined basic types to be able to display all options.  More
     basic types may be added in future versions.  If the GUI encounters
     a basic type it doesn't support, it should report an error and
     abort the operation.

ARGNAME
     This field is only defined for options with an argument type TYPE
     that is not '0'.  In this case it may contain a _percent-escaped_
     and _localized string_ that gives a short name for the argument.
     The field may also be empty, though, in which case a short name is
     not known.

DEFAULT
     This field is defined only for options for which the 'default' or
     'default desc' flag is set.  If the 'default' flag is set, its
     format is that of an _option argument_ (*note Format conventions::,
     for details).  If the default value is empty, then no default is
     known.  Otherwise, the value specifies the default value for this
     option.  If the 'default desc' flag is set, the field is either
     empty or contains a description of the effect if the option is not
     given.

ARGDEF
     This field is defined only for options for which the 'optional arg'
     flag is set.  If the 'no arg desc' flag is not set, its format is
     that of an _option argument_ (*note Format conventions::, for
     details).  If the default value is empty, then no default is known.
     Otherwise, the value specifies the default argument for this
     option.  If the 'no arg desc' flag is set, the field is either
     empty or contains a description of the effect of this option if no
     argument is given.

VALUE
     This field is defined only for options.  Its format is that of an
     _option argument_.  If it is empty, then the option is not
     explicitly set in the current configuration, and the default
     applies (if any).  Otherwise, it contains the current value of the
     option.  Note that this field is also meaningful if the option
     itself does not take a real argument (in this case, it contains the
     number of times the option appears).

9.4.6 Changing options
----------------------

The command '--change-options COMPONENT' will attempt to change the
options of the component COMPONENT to the specified values.  COMPONENT
must be the string in the field NAME in the output of the
'--list-components' command.  You have to provide the options that shall
be changed in the following format on standard input:

   'NAME:FLAGS:NEW-VALUE'

NAME
     This is the name of the option to change.  NAME must be the string
     in the field NAME in the output of the '--list-options' command.

FLAGS
     The flags field contains an _unsigned number_.  Its value is the
     OR-wise combination of the following flag values:

     'default (16)'
          If this flag is set, the option is deleted and the default
          value is used instead (if applicable).

NEW-VALUE
     The new value for the option.  This field is only defined if the
     'default' flag is not set.  The format is that of an _option
     argument_.  If it is empty (or the field is omitted), the default
     argument is used (only allowed if the argument is optional for this
     option).  Otherwise, the option will be set to the specified value.

The output of the command is the same as that of '--check-options' for
the modified configuration file.

   Examples:

   To set the force option, which is of basic type 'none (0)':

     $ echo 'force:0:1' | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

   To delete the force option:

     $ echo 'force:16:' | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

   The '--runtime' option can influence when the changes take effect.

9.4.7 Listing global options
----------------------------

Sometimes it is useful for applications to look at the global options
file 'gpgconf.conf'.  The colon separated listing format is record
oriented and uses the first field to identify the record type:

'k'
     This describes a key record to start the definition of a new
     ruleset for a user/group.  The format of a key record is:

     'k:USER:GROUP:'

     USER
          This is the user field of the key.  It is percent escaped.
          See the definition of the gpgconf.conf format for details.

     GROUP
          This is the group field of the key.  It is percent escaped.

'r'
     This describes a rule record.  All rule records up to the next key
     record make up a rule set for that key.  The format of a rule
     record is:

     'r:::COMPONENT:OPTION:FLAG:VALUE:'

     COMPONENT
          This is the component part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

     OPTION
          This is the option part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

     FLAG
          This is the flags part of a rule.  There may be only one flag
          per rule but by using the same component and option, several
          flags may be assigned to an option.  It is a plain string.

     VALUE
          This is the optional value for the option.  It is a percent
          escaped string with a single quotation mark to indicate a
          string.  The quotation mark is only required to distinguish
          between no value specified and an empty string.

Unknown record types should be ignored.  Note that there is
intentionally no feature to change the global option file through
'gpgconf'.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Querying versions,  Next: Files used by gpgconf,  Prev: Listing global options,  Up: gpgconf

9.4.8 Get and compare software versions.
----------------------------------------

The GnuPG Project operates a server to query the current versions of
software packages related to GnuPG. 'gpgconf' can be used to access this
online database.  To allow for offline operations, this feature works by
having 'dirmngr' download a file from 'https://versions.gnupg.org',
checking the signature of that file and storing the file in the GnuPG
home directory.  If 'gpgconf' is used and 'dirmngr' is running, it may
ask 'dirmngr' to refresh that file before itself uses the file.

   The command '--query-swdb' returns information for the given package
in a colon delimited format:

NAME
     This is the name of the package as requested.  Note that "gnupg" is
     a special name which is replaced by the actual package implementing
     this version of GnuPG. For this name it is also not required to
     specify a version because 'gpgconf' takes its own version in this
     case.

IVERSION
     The currently installed version or an empty string.  The value is
     taken from the command line argument but may be provided by gpg if
     not given.

STATUS
     The status of the software package according to this table:
     '-'
          No information available.  This is either because no current
          version has been specified or due to an error.
     '?'
          The given name is not known in the online database.
     'u'
          An update of the software is available.
     'c'
          The installed version of the software is current.
     'n'
          The installed version is already newer than the released
          version.

URGENCY
     If the value (the empty string should be considered as zero) is
     greater than zero an important update is available.

ERROR
     This returns an 'gpg-error' error code to distinguish between
     various failure modes.

FILEDATE
     This gives the date of the file with the version numbers in
     standard ISO format ('yyyymmddThhmmss').  The date has been
     extracted by 'dirmngr' from the signature of the file.

VERIFIED
     This gives the date in ISO format the file was downloaded.  This
     value can be used to evaluate the freshness of the information.

VERSION
     This returns the version string for the requested software from the
     file.

RELDATE
     This returns the release date in ISO format.

SIZE
     This returns the size of the package as decimal number of bytes.

HASH
     This returns a hexified SHA-2 hash of the package.

More fields may be added in future to the output.

9.4.9 Files used by gpgconf
---------------------------

'/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf'
     If this file exists, it is processed as a global configuration
     file.  A commented example can be found in the 'examples' directory
     of the distribution.

'GNUPGHOME/swdb.lst'
     A file with current software versions.  'dirmngr' creates this file
     on demand from an online resource.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: applygnupgdefaults,  Next: gpg-preset-passphrase,  Prev: gpgconf,  Up: Helper Tools

9.5 Run gpgconf for all users
=============================

This script is a wrapper around 'gpgconf' to run it with the command
'--apply-defaults' for all real users with an existing GnuPG home
directory.  Admins might want to use this script to update he GnuPG
configuration files for all users after '/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf' has
been changed.  This allows enforcing certain policies for all users.
Note, that this is not a bulletproof way to force a user to use certain
options.  A user may always directly edit the configuration files and
bypass gpgconf.

'applygnupgdefaults' is invoked by root as:

     applygnupgdefaults


File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpg-preset-passphrase,  Next: gpg-connect-agent,  Prev: applygnupgdefaults,  Up: Helper Tools

9.6 Put a passphrase into the cache
===================================

The 'gpg-preset-passphrase' is a utility to seed the internal cache of a
running 'gpg-agent' with passphrases.  It is mainly useful for
unattended machines, where the usual 'pinentry' tool may not be used and
the passphrases for the to be used keys are given at machine startup.

   This program works with GnuPG 2 and later.  GnuPG 1.x is not
supported.

   Passphrases set with this utility don't expire unless the '--forget'
option is used to explicitly clear them from the cache -- or 'gpg-agent'
is either restarted or reloaded (by sending a SIGHUP to it).  Note that
the maximum cache time as set with '--max-cache-ttl' is still honored.
It is necessary to allow this passphrase presetting by starting
'gpg-agent' with the '--allow-preset-passphrase'.

* Invoking gpg-preset-passphrase::   List of all commands and options.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpg-preset-passphrase,  Up: gpg-preset-passphrase

9.6.1 List of all commands and options
--------------------------------------

'gpg-preset-passphrase' is invoked this way:

     gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command] CACHEID

   CACHEID is either a 40 character keygrip of hexadecimal characters
identifying the key for which the passphrase should be set or cleared.
The keygrip is listed along with the key when running the command:
'gpgsm --with-keygrip --list-secret-keys'.  Alternatively an arbitrary
string may be used to identify a passphrase; it is suggested that such a
string is prefixed with the name of the application (e.g 'foo:12346').
Scripts should always use the option '--with-colons', which provides the
keygrip in a "grp" line (cf.  'doc/DETAILS')/

One of the following command options must be given:

'--preset'
     Preset a passphrase.  This is what you usually will use.
     'gpg-preset-passphrase' will then read the passphrase from 'stdin'.

'--forget'
     Flush the passphrase for the given cache ID from the cache.

The following additional options may be used:

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Output additional information while running.

'-P STRING'
'--passphrase STRING'
     Instead of reading the passphrase from 'stdin', use the supplied
     STRING as passphrase.  Note that this makes the passphrase visible
     for other users.

9.7 Communicate with a running agent
====================================

The 'gpg-connect-agent' is a utility to communicate with a running
'gpg-agent'.  It is useful to check out the commands 'gpg-agent'
provides using the Assuan interface.  It might also be useful for
scripting simple applications.  Input is expected at stdin and output
gets printed to stdout.

   It is very similar to running 'gpg-agent' in server mode; but here we
connect to a running instance.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpg-connect-agent,  Next: Controlling gpg-connect-agent,  Up: gpg-connect-agent

9.7.1 List of all options
-------------------------

'gpg-connect-agent' is invoked this way:

     gpg-connect-agent [options] [commands]

The following options may be used:

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Output additional information while running.

'-q'
'--quiet'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

'--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME'
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

     To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
     empty file named 'gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the tool
     'gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is then that
     directory; or, if 'gpgconf.exe' has been installed directly below a
     directory named 'bin', its parent directory.  You also need to make
     sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
     'ROOT/home' for the GnuPG home and 'ROOT/usr/local/var/cache/gnupg'
     for internal cache files.

'--agent-program FILE'
     Specify the agent program to be started if none is running.  The
     default value is determined by running 'gpgconf' with the option
     '--list-dirs'.  Note that the pipe symbol ('|') is used for a
     regression test suite hack and may thus not be used in the file
     name.

'--dirmngr-program FILE'
     Specify the directory manager (keyserver client) program to be
     started if none is running.  This has only an effect if used
     together with the option '--dirmngr'.

'--dirmngr'
     Connect to a running directory manager (keyserver client) instead
     of to the gpg-agent.  If a dirmngr is not running, start it.

'-S'
'--raw-socket NAME'
     Connect to socket NAME assuming this is an Assuan style server.  Do
     not run any special initializations or environment checks.  This
     may be used to directly connect to any Assuan style socket server.

'-E'
'--exec'
     Take the rest of the command line as a program and it's arguments
     and execute it as an Assuan server.  Here is how you would run
     'gpgsm':
           gpg-connect-agent --exec gpgsm --server
     Note that you may not use options on the command line in this case.

'--no-ext-connect'
     When using '-S' or '--exec', 'gpg-connect-agent' connects to the
     Assuan server in extended mode to allow descriptor passing.  This
     option makes it use the old mode.

'--no-autostart'
     Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
     started.

'-r FILE'
'--run FILE'
     Run the commands from FILE at startup and then continue with the
     regular input method.  Note, that commands given on the command
     line are executed after this file.

'-s'
'--subst'
     Run the command '/subst' at startup.

'--hex'
     Print data lines in a hex format and the ASCII representation of
     non-control characters.

'--decode'
     Decode data lines.  That is to remove percent escapes but make sure
     that a new line always starts with a D and a space.

9.7.2 Control commands
----------------------

While reading Assuan commands, gpg-agent also allows a few special
commands to control its operation.  These control commands all start
with a slash ('/').

'/echo ARGS'
     Just print ARGS.

'/let NAME VALUE'
     Set the variable NAME to VALUE.  Variables are only substituted on
     the input if the '/subst' has been used.  Variables are referenced
     by prefixing the name with a dollar sign and optionally include the
     name in curly braces.  The rules for a valid name are identically
     to those of the standard bourne shell.  This is not yet enforced
     but may be in the future.  When used with curly braces no leading
     or trailing white space is allowed.

     If a variable is not found, it is searched in the environment and
     if found copied to the table of variables.

     Variable functions are available: The name of the function must be
     followed by at least one space and the at least one argument.  The
     following functions are available:

     'get'
          Return a value described by the argument.  Available arguments
          are:

          'cwd'
               The current working directory.
          'homedir'
               The gnupg homedir.
          'sysconfdir'
               GnuPG's system configuration directory.
          'bindir'
               GnuPG's binary directory.
          'libdir'
               GnuPG's library directory.
          'libexecdir'
               GnuPG's library directory for executable files.
          'datadir'
               GnuPG's data directory.
          'serverpid'
               The PID of the current server.  Command '/serverpid' must
               have been given to return a useful value.

     'unescape ARGS'
          Remove C-style escapes from ARGS.  Note that '\0' and '\x00'
          terminate the returned string implicitly.  The string to be
          converted are the entire arguments right behind the delimiting
          space of the function name.

     'unpercent ARGS'
     'unpercent+ ARGS'
          Remove percent style escaping from ARGS.  Note that '%00'
          terminates the string implicitly.  The string to be converted
          are the entire arguments right behind the delimiting space of
          the function name.  'unpercent+' also maps plus signs to a
          spaces.

     'percent ARGS'
     'percent+ ARGS'
          Escape the ARGS using percent style escaping.  Tabs,
          formfeeds, linefeeds, carriage returns and colons are escaped.
          'percent+' also maps spaces to plus signs.

     'errcode ARG'
     'errsource ARG'
     'errstring ARG'
          Assume ARG is an integer and evaluate it using 'strtol'.
          Return the gpg-error error code, error source or a formatted
          string with the error code and error source.

     '+'
     '-'
     '*'
     '/'
     '%'
          Evaluate all arguments as long integers using 'strtol' and
          apply this operator.  A division by zero yields an empty
          string.

     '!'
     '|'
     '&'
          Evaluate all arguments as long integers using 'strtol' and
          apply the logical operators NOT, OR or AND. The NOT operator
          works on the last argument only.

'/definq NAME VAR'
     Use content of the variable VAR for inquiries with NAME.  NAME may
     be an asterisk ('*') to match any inquiry.

'/definqfile NAME FILE'
     Use content of FILE for inquiries with NAME.  NAME may be an
     asterisk ('*') to match any inquiry.

'/definqprog NAME PROG'
     Run PROG for inquiries matching NAME and pass the entire line to it
     as command line arguments.

'/datafile NAME'
     Write all data lines from the server to the file NAME.  The file is
     opened for writing and created if it does not exists.  An existing
     file is first truncated to 0.  The data written to the file fully
     decoded.  Using a single dash for NAME writes to stdout.  The file
     is kept open until a new file is set using this command or this
     command is used without an argument.

'/showdef'
     Print all definitions

'/cleardef'
     Delete all definitions

'/sendfd FILE MODE'
     Open FILE in MODE (which needs to be a valid 'fopen' mode string)
     and send the file descriptor to the server.  This is usually
     followed by a command like 'INPUT FD' to set the input source for
     other commands.

'/recvfd'
     Not yet implemented.

'/open VAR FILE [MODE]'
     Open FILE and assign the file descriptor to VAR.  Warning: This
     command is experimental and might change in future versions.

'/close FD'
     Close the file descriptor FD.  Warning: This command is
     experimental and might change in future versions.

'/showopen'
     Show a list of open files.

'/serverpid'
     Send the Assuan command 'GETINFO pid' to the server and store the
     returned PID for internal purposes.

'/sleep'
     Sleep for a second.

'/hex'
'/nohex'
     Same as the command line option '--hex'.

'/decode'
'/nodecode'
     Same as the command line option '--decode'.

'/subst'
'/nosubst'
     Enable and disable variable substitution.  It defaults to disabled
     unless the command line option '--subst' has been used.  If /subst
     as been enabled once, leading whitespace is removed from input
     lines which makes scripts easier to read.

'/while CONDITION'
'/end'
     These commands provide a way for executing loops.  All lines
     between the 'while' and the corresponding 'end' are executed as
     long as the evaluation of CONDITION yields a non-zero value or is
     the string 'true' or 'yes'.  The evaluation is done by passing
     CONDITION to the 'strtol' function.  Example:

            /subst
            /let i 3
            /while $i
              /echo loop counter is $i
              /let i ${- $i 1}
            /end

'/if CONDITION'
'/end'
     These commands provide a way for conditional execution.  All lines
     between the 'if' and the corresponding 'end' are executed only if
     the evaluation of CONDITION yields a non-zero value or is the
     string 'true' or 'yes'.  The evaluation is done by passing
     CONDITION to the 'strtol' function.

'/run FILE'
     Run commands from FILE.

'/bye'
     Terminate the connection and the program.

'/help'
     Print a list of available control commands.

9.8 The Dirmngr Client Tool
===========================

The 'dirmngr-client' is a simple tool to contact a running dirmngr and
test whether a certificate has been revoked -- either by being listed in
the corresponding CRL or by running the OCSP protocol.  If no dirmngr is
running, a new instances will be started but this is in general not a
good idea due to the huge performance overhead.

The usual way to run this tool is either:

     dirmngr-client ACERT

or

     dirmngr-client <ACERT

   Where ACERT is one DER encoded (binary) X.509 certificates to be
tested.  The return value of this command is

'0'
     The certificate under question is valid; i.e.  there is a valid CRL
     available and it is not listed there or the OCSP request returned
     that that certificate is valid.

'1'
     The certificate has been revoked

'2 (and other values)'
     There was a problem checking the revocation state of the
     certificate.  A message to stderr has given more detailed
     information.  Most likely this is due to a missing or expired CRL
     or due to a network problem.

'dirmngr-client' may be called with the following options:

'--version'
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

'--help, -h'
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

'--quiet, -q'
     Make the output extra brief by suppressing any informational
     messages.

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to DIRMNGR, such as
     '-vv'.

'--pem'
     Assume that the given certificate is in PEM (armored) format.

'--ocsp'
     Do the check using the OCSP protocol and ignore any CRLs.

'--force-default-responder'
     When checking using the OCSP protocol, force the use of the default
     OCSP responder.  That is not to use the Reponder as given by the
     certificate.

'--ping'
     Check whether the dirmngr daemon is up and running.

'--cache-cert'
     Put the given certificate into the cache of a running dirmngr.
     This is mainly useful for debugging.

'--validate'
     Validate the given certificate using dirmngr's internal validation
     code.  This is mainly useful for debugging.

'--load-crl'
     This command expects a list of filenames with DER encoded CRL
     files.  With the option '--url' URLs are expected in place of
     filenames and they are loaded directly from the given location.
     All CRLs will be validated and then loaded into dirmngr's cache.

'--lookup'
     Take the remaining arguments and run a lookup command on each of
     them.  The results are Base-64 encoded outputs (without header
     lines).  This may be used to retrieve certificates from a server.
     However the output format is not very well suited if more than one
     certificate is returned.

'--url'
'-u'
     Modify the 'lookup' and 'load-crl' commands to take an URL.

'--local'
'-l'
     Let the 'lookup' command only search the local cache.

'--squid-mode'
     Run DIRMNGR-CLIENT in a mode suitable as a helper program for
     Squid's 'external_acl_type' option.

9.10 Call a simple symmetric encryption tool
============================================

Sometimes simple encryption tools are already in use for a long time and
there might be a desire to integrate them into the GnuPG framework.  The
protocols and encryption methods might be non-standard or not even
properly documented, so that a full-fledged encryption tool with an
interface like 'gpg' is not doable.  'symcryptrun' provides a solution:
It operates by calling the external encryption/decryption module and
provides a passphrase for a key using the standard 'pinentry' based
mechanism through 'gpg-agent'.

   Note, that 'symcryptrun' is only available if GnuPG has been
configured with '--enable-symcryptrun' at build time.

* Menu:

* Invoking symcryptrun::   List of all commands and options.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking symcryptrun,  Up: symcryptrun

9.10.1 List of all commands and options
---------------------------------------

'symcryptrun' is invoked this way:

     symcryptrun --class CLASS --program PROGRAM --keyfile KEYFILE
        [--decrypt | --encrypt] [inputfile]

   For encryption, the plain text must be provided on STDIN or as the
argument INPUTFILE, and the ciphertext will be output to STDOUT. For
decryption vice versa.

   CLASS describes the calling conventions of the external tool.
Currently it must be given as 'confucius'.  PROGRAM is the full filename
of that external tool.

   For the class 'confucius' the option '--keyfile' is required; KEYFILE
is the name of a file containing the secret key, which may be protected
by a passphrase.  For detailed calling conventions, see the source code.

Note, that 'gpg-agent' must be running before starting 'symcryptrun'.

The following additional options may be used:

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Output additional information while running.

'-q'
'--quiet'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

'--homedir DIR'
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to '~/.gnupg'.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable 'GNUPGHOME'
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

     To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
     empty file named 'gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the tool
     'gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is then that
     directory; or, if 'gpgconf.exe' has been installed directly below a
     directory named 'bin', its parent directory.  You also need to make
     sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
     'ROOT/home' for the GnuPG home and 'ROOT/usr/local/var/cache/gnupg'
     for internal cache files.

'--log-file FILE'
     Append all logging output to FILE.  Use 'socket://' to log to
     socket.  Default is to write logging information to STDERR.

The possible exit status codes of 'symcryptrun' are:

'0'
     Success.
'1'
     Some error occurred.
'2'
     No valid passphrase was provided.
'3'
     The operation was canceled by the user.

9.11 Encrypt or sign files into an archive
==========================================

'gpgtar' encrypts or signs files into an archive.  It is an gpg-ized tar
using the same format as used by PGP's PGP Zip.

'gpgtar' is invoked this way:

     gpgtar [options] FILENAME1 [FILENAME2, ...] DIRECTORY [DIRECTORY2, ...]

'gpgtar' understands these options:

'--create'
     Put given files and directories into a vanilla "ustar" archive.

'--extract'
     Extract all files from a vanilla "ustar" archive.

'--encrypt'
'-e'
     Encrypt given files and directories into an archive.  This option
     may be combined with option '--symmetric' for an archive that may
     be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase.

'--decrypt'
'-d'
     Extract all files from an encrypted archive.

'--sign'
'-s'
     Make a signed archive from the given files and directories.  This
     can be combined with option '--encrypt' to create a signed and then
     encrypted archive.

'--list-archive'
'-t'
     List the contents of the specified archive.

'--symmetric'
'-c'
     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default
     symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the
     '--cipher-algo' option to 'gpg'.

'--recipient USER'
'-r USER'
     Encrypt for user id USER.  For details see 'gpg'.

'--local-user USER'
'-u USER'
     Use USER as the key to sign with.  For details see 'gpg'.

'--output FILE'
'-o FILE'
     Write the archive to the specified file FILE.

'--verbose'
'-v'
     Enable extra informational output.

'--quiet'
'-q'
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

'--skip-crypto'
     Skip all crypto operations and create or extract vanilla "ustar"
     archives.

'--dry-run'
     Do not actually output the extracted files.

'--directory DIR'
'-C DIR'
     Extract the files into the directory DIR.  The default is to take
     the directory name from the input filename.  If no input filename
     is known a directory named 'GPGARCH' is used.  For tarball
     creation, switch to directory DIR before performing any operations.

'--files-from FILE'
'-T FILE'
     Take the file names to work from the file FILE; one file per line.

'--null'
     Modify option '--files-from' to use a binary nul instead of a
     linefeed to separate file names.

'--utf8-strings'
     Assume that the file names read by '--files-from' are UTF-8
     encoded.  This option has an effect only on Windows where the
     active code page is otherwise assumed.

'--openpgp'
     This option has no effect because OpenPGP encryption and signing is
     the default.

'--cms'
     This option is reserved and shall not be used.  It will eventually
     be used to encrypt or sign using the CMS protocol; but that is not
     yet implemented.

'--set-filename FILE'
     Use the last component of FILE as the output directory.  The
     default is to take the directory name from the input filename.  If
     no input filename is known a directory named 'GPGARCH' is used.
     This option is deprecated in favor of option '--directory'.

'--gpg GPGCMD'
     Use the specified command GPGCMD instead of 'gpg'.

'--gpg-args ARGS'
     Pass the specified extra options to 'gpg'.

'--tar-args ARGS'
     Assume ARGS are standard options of the command 'tar' and parse
     them.  The only supported tar options are "-directory",
     "-files-from", and "-null" This is an obsolete options because
     those supported tar options can also be given directly.

'--version'
     Print version of the program and exit.

'--help'
     Display a brief help page and exit.

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 otherwise.

Some examples:

Encrypt the contents of directory 'mydocs' for user Bob to file 'test1':

     gpgtar --encrypt --output test1 -r Bob mydocs

List the contents of archive 'test1':

     gpgtar --list-archive test1

10 Web Key Service
******************

GnuPG comes with tools used to maintain and access a Web Key Directory.

* Menu:

* gpg-wks-client::        Send requests via WKS
* gpg-wks-server::        Server to provide the WKS.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpg-wks-client,  Next: gpg-wks-server,  Up: Web Key Service

10.1 Send requests via WKS
==========================

The 'gpg-wks-client' is used to send requests to a Web Key Service
provider.  This is usuallay done to upload a key into a Web Key
Directory.

   With the '--supported' command the caller can test whether a site
supports the Web Key Service.  The argument is an arbitrary address in
the to be tested domain.  For example 'foo@example.net'.  The command
returns success if the Web Key Service is supported.  The operation is
silent; to get diagnostic output use the option '--verbose'.  See option
'--with-colons' for a variant of this command.

   With the '--check' command the caller can test whether a key exists
for a supplied mail address.  The command returns success if a key is
available.

   The '--create' command is used to send a request for publication in
the Web Key Directory.  The arguments are the fingerprint of the key and
the user id to publish.  The output from the command is a properly
formatted mail with all standard headers.  This mail can be fed to
'sendmail(8)' or any other tool to actually send that mail.  If
'sendmail(8)' is installed the option '--send' can be used to directly
send the created request.  If the provider request a 'mailbox-only' user
id and no such user id is found, 'gpg-wks-client' will try an additional
user id.

   The '--receive' and '--read' commands are used to process
confirmation mails as send from the service provider.  The former
expects an encrypted MIME messages, the latter an already decrypted MIME
message.  The result of these commands are another mail which can be
send in the same way as the mail created with '--create'.

   The command '--install-key' manually installs a key into a local
directory (see option '-C') reflecting the structure of a WKD. The
arguments are a file with the keyblock and the user-id to install.  If
the first argument resembles a fingerprint the key is taken from the
current keyring; to force the use of a file, prefix the first argument
with "./".  If no arguments are given the parameters are read from
stdin; the expected format are lines with the fingerprint and the
mailbox separated by a space.  The command '--remove-key' removes a key
from that directory, its only argument is a user-id.

   The command '--print-wkd-hash' prints the WKD user-id identifiers and
the corresponding mailboxes from the user-ids given on the command line
or via stdin (one user-id per line).

   The command '--print-wkd-url' prints the URLs used to fetch the key
for the given user-ids from WKD. The meanwhile preferred format with
sub-domains is used here.

   'gpg-wks-client' is not commonly invoked directly and thus it is not
installed in the bin directory.  Here is an example how it can be
invoked manually to check for a Web Key Directory entry for
'foo@example.org':

     $(gpgconf --list-dirs libexecdir)/gpg-wks-client --check foo@example.net

'gpg-wks-client' understands these options:

'--send'
     Directly send created mails using the 'sendmail' command.  Requires
     installation of that command.

'--with-colons'
     This option has currently only an effect on the '--supported'
     command.  If it is used all arguments on the command line are taken
     as domain names and tested for WKD support.  The output format is
     one line per domain with colon delimited fields.  The currently
     specified fields are (future versions may specify additional
     fields):

     1 - domain
          This is the domain name.  Although quoting is not required for
          valid domain names this field is specified to be quoted in
          standard C manner.

     2 - WKD
          If the value is true the domain supports the Web Key
          Directory.

     3 - WKS
          If the value is true the domain supports the Web Key Service
          protocol to upload keys to the directory.

     4 - error-code
          This may contain an gpg-error code to describe certain
          failures.  Use 'gpg-error CODE' to explain the code.

     5 - protocol-version
          The minimum protocol version supported by the server.

     6 - auth-submit
          The auth-submit flag from the policy file of the server.

     7 - mailbox-only
          The mailbox-only flag from the policy file of the server.

'--output FILE'
'-o'
     Write the created mail to FILE instead of stdout.  Note that the
     value '-' for FILE is the same as writing to stdout.

'--status-fd N'
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  This
     program returns only the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which
     are helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can't
     easily get the return code of the process.

'-C DIR'
'--directory DIR'
     Use DIR as top level directory for the commands '--install-key' and
     '--remove-key'.  The default is 'openpgpkey'.

'--verbose'
     Enable extra informational output.

'--quiet'
     Disable almost all informational output.

'--version'
     Print version of the program and exit.

'--help'
     Display a brief help page and exit.

10.2 Provide the Web Key Service
================================

The 'gpg-wks-server' is a server site implementation of the Web Key
Service.  It receives requests for publication, sends confirmation
requests, receives confirmations, and published the key.  It also has
features to ease the setup and maintenance of a Web Key Directory.

   When used with the command '--receive' a single Web Key Service mail
is processed.  Commonly this command is used with the option '--send' to
directly send the crerated mails back.  See below for an installation
example.

   The command '--cron' is used for regualr cleanup tasks.  For example
non-confirmed requested should be removed after their expire time.  It
is best to run this command once a day from a cronjob.

   The command '--list-domains' prints all configured domains.  Further
it creates missing directories for the configuration and prints warnings
pertaining to problems in the configuration.

   The command '--check-key' (or just '--check') checks whether a key
with the given user-id is installed.  The process returns success in
this case; to also print a diagnostic use the option '-v'.  If the key
is not installed a diagnostic is printed and the process returns
failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option '-q'.  More than one
user-id can be given; see also option 'with-file'.

   The command '--install-key' manually installs a key into the WKD. The
arguments are a file with the keyblock and the user-id to install.  If
the first argument resembles a fingerprint the key is taken from the
current keyring; to force the use of a file, prefix the first argument
with "./".  If no arguments are given the parameters are read from
stdin; the expected format are lines with the fingerprint and the
mailbox separated by a space.

   The command '--remove-key' uninstalls a key from the WKD. The process
returns success in this case; to also print a diagnostic, use option
'-v'.  If the key is not installed a diagnostic is printed and the
process returns failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option '-q'.

   The command '--revoke-key' is not yet functional.

'gpg-wks-server' understands these options:

'-C DIR'
'--directory DIR'
     Use DIR as top level directory for domains.  The default is
     '/var/lib/gnupg/wks'.

'--from MAILADDR'
     Use MAILADDR as the default sender address.

'--header NAME=VALUE'
     Add the mail header "NAME: VALUE" to all outgoing mails.

'--send'
     Directly send created mails using the 'sendmail' command.  Requires
     installation of that command.

'-o FILE'
'--output FILE'
     Write the created mail also to FILE.  Note that the value '-' for
     FILE would write it to stdout.

'--with-dir'
     When used with the command '--list-domains' print for each
     installed domain the domain name and its directory name.

'--with-file'
     When used with the command '--check-key' print for each user-id,
     the address, 'i' for installed key or 'n' for not installed key,
     and the filename.

'--verbose'
     Enable extra informational output.

'--quiet'
     Disable almost all informational output.

'--version'
     Print version of the program and exit.

'--help'
     Display a brief help page and exit.


Examples
********

The Web Key Service requires a working directory to store keys pending
for publication.  As root create a working directory:

       # mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks
       # chown webkey:webkey /var/lib/gnupg/wks
       # chmod 2750 /var/lib/gnupg/wks

   Then under your webkey account create directories for all your
domains.  Here we do it for "example.net":

       $ mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net

   Finally run

       $ gpg-wks-server --list-domains

   to create the required sub-directories with the permissions set
correctly.  For each domain a submission address needs to be configured.
All service mails are directed to that address.  It can be the same
address for all configured domains, for example:

       $ cd /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net
       $ echo key-submission@example.net >submission-address

   The protocol requires that the key to be published is send with an
encrypted mail to the service.  Thus you need to create a key for the
submission address:

       $ gpg --batch --passphrase '' --quick-gen-key key-submission@example.net
       $ gpg -K key-submission@example.net

   The output of the last command looks similar to this:

       sec   rsa2048 2016-08-30 [SC]
             C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B
       uid           [ultimate] key-submission@example.net
       ssb   rsa2048 2016-08-30 [E]

   Take the fingerprint from that output and manually publish the key:

       $ gpg-wks-server --install-key C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B \
       >                key-submission@example.net

   Finally that submission address needs to be redirected to a script
running 'gpg-wks-server'.  The 'procmail' command can be used for this:
Redirect the submission address to the user "webkey" and put this into
webkey's '.procmailrc':

     :0
     * !^From: webkey@example.net
     * !^X-WKS-Loop: webkey.example.net
     |gpg-wks-server -v --receive \
          --header X-WKS-Loop=webkey.example.net \
          --from webkey@example.net --send

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Howto Create a Server Cert,  Up: Howtos

11.1 Creating a TLS server certificate
======================================

Here is a brief run up on how to create a server certificate.  It has
actually been done this way to get a certificate from CAcert to be used
on a real server.  It has only been tested with this CA, but there
shouldn't be any problem to run this against any other CA.

   We start by generating an X.509 certificate signing request.  As
there is no need for a configuration file, you may simply enter:

       $ gpgsm --generate-key >example.com.cert-req.pem
       Please select what kind of key you want:
          (1) RSA
          (2) Existing key
          (3) Existing key from card
       Your selection? 1

   I opted for creating a new RSA key.  The other option is to use an
already existing key, by selecting '2' and entering the so-called
keygrip.  Running the command 'gpgsm --dump-secret-key USERID' shows you
this keygrip.  Using '3' offers another menu to create a certificate
directly from a smart card based key.

   Let's continue:

       What keysize do you want? (3072)
       Requested keysize is 3072 bits

   Hitting enter chooses the default RSA key size of 3072 bits.  Keys
smaller than 2048 bits are too weak on the modern Internet.  If you
choose a larger (stronger) key, your server will need to do more work.

       Possible actions for a RSA key:
          (1) sign, encrypt
          (2) sign
          (3) encrypt
       Your selection? 1

   Selecting "sign" enables use of the key for Diffie-Hellman key
exchange mechanisms (DHE and ECDHE) in TLS, which are preferred because
they offer forward secrecy.  Selecting "encrypt" enables RSA key
exchange mechanisms, which are still common in some places.  Selecting
both enables both key exchange mechanisms.

   Now for some real data:

       Enter the X.509 subject name: CN=example.com

   This is the most important value for a server certificate.  Enter
here the canonical name of your server machine.  You may add other
virtual server names later.

       E-Mail addresses (end with an empty line):
       >

   We don't need email addresses in a TLS server certificate and CAcert
would anyway ignore such a request.  Thus just hit enter.

   If you want to create a client certificate for email encryption, this
would be the place to enter your mail address (e.g.  <joe@example.org>).
You may enter as many addresses as you like, however the CA may not
accept them all or reject the entire request.

       Enter DNS names (optional; end with an empty line):
       > example.com
       > www.example.com
       >

   Here I entered the names of the services which the machine actually
provides.  You almost always want to include the canonical name here
too.  The browser will accept a certificate for any of these names.  As
usual the CA must approve all of these names.

       URIs (optional; end with an empty line):
       >

   It is possible to insert arbitrary URIs into a certificate; for a
server certificate this does not make sense.

       Create self-signed certificate? (y/N)

   Since we are creating a certificate signing request, and not a full
certificate, we answer no here, or just hit enter for the default.

   We have now entered all required information and 'gpgsm' will display
what it has gathered and ask whether to create the certificate request:

       These parameters are used:
           Key-Type: RSA
           Key-Length: 3072
           Key-Usage: sign, encrypt
           Name-DN: CN=example.com
           Name-DNS: example.com
           Name-DNS: www.example.com

       Proceed with creation? (y/N) y

   'gpgsm' will now start working on creating the request.  As this
includes the creation of an RSA key it may take a while.  During this
time you will be asked 3 times for a passphrase to protect the created
private key on your system.  A pop up window will appear to ask for it.
The first two prompts are for the new passphrase and for re-entering it;
the third one is required to actually create the certificate signing
request.

   When it is ready, you should see the final notice:

       Ready.  You should now send this request to your CA.

   Now, you may look at the created request:

       $ cat example.com.cert-req.pem
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

   You may now proceed by logging into your account at the CAcert
website, choose 'Server Certificates - New', check 'sign by class 3 root
certificate', paste the above request block into the text field and
click on 'Submit'.

   If everything works out fine, a certificate will be shown.  Now run

     $ gpgsm --import

   and paste the certificate from the CAcert page into your terminal
followed by a Ctrl-D

       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

   'gpgsm' tells you that it has imported the certificate.  It is now
associated with the key you used when creating the request.  The root
certificate has not been found, so you may want to import it from the
CACert website.

   To see the content of your certificate, you may now enter:

       $ gpgsm -K example.com

   I used '-K' above because this will only list certificates for which
a private key is available.  To see more details, you may use
'--dump-secret-keys' instead of '-K'.

   To make actual use of the certificate you need to install it on your
server.  Server software usually expects a PKCS\#12 file with key and
certificate.  To create such a file, run:

       $ gpgsm --export-secret-key-p12 -a >example.com-cert.pem

   You will be asked for the passphrase as well as for a new passphrase
to be used to protect the PKCS\#12 file.  The file now contains the
certificate as well as the private key:

       $ cat example-cert.pem
       Issuer ...: /CN=CAcert Class 3 Root/OU=http:\x2f\x2fwww.CA[...]
       Serial ...: 4C

       [...many more lines...]
       -----END PKCS12-----
       $

   Copy this file in a secure way to the server, install it there and
delete the file then.  You may export the file again at any time as long
as it is available in GnuPG's private key database.

12 Notes pertaining to certain OSes
***********************************

GnuPG has been developed on GNU/Linux systems and is know to work on
almost all Free OSes.  All modern POSIX systems should be supported
right now, however there are probably a lot of smaller glitches we need
to fix first.  The major problem areas are:

   * We are planning to use file descriptor passing for interprocess
     communication.  This will allow us save a lot of resources and
     improve performance of certain operations a lot.  Systems not
     supporting this won't gain these benefits but we try to keep them
     working the standard way as it is done today.

   * We require more or less full POSIX compatibility.  This has been
     around for 15 years now and thus we don't believe it makes sense to
     support non POSIX systems anymore.  Well, we of course the usual
     workarounds for near POSIX systems well be applied.

     There is one exception of this rule: Systems based the Microsoft
     Windows API (called here _W32_) will be supported to some extend.

12.1 Microsoft Windows Notes
============================

Current limitations are:

   * 'gpgconf' does not create backup files, so in case of trouble your
     configuration file might get lost.

   * 'watchgnupg' is not available.  Logging to sockets is not possible.

   * The periodical smartcard status checking done by 'scdaemon' is not
     yet supported.

13 How to solve problems
************************

Everyone knows that software often does not do what it should do and
thus there is a need to track down problems.  We call this debugging in
a reminiscent to the moth jamming a relay in a Mark II box back in 1947.

   Most of the problems a merely configuration and user problems but
nevertheless they are the most annoying ones and responsible for many
gray hairs.  We try to give some guidelines here on how to identify and
solve the problem at hand.

* Menu:

* Debugging Tools::       Description of some useful tools.
* Debugging Hints::       Various hints on debugging.

13.1 Debugging Tools
====================

The GnuPG distribution comes with a couple of tools, useful to help find
and solving problems.

* Menu:

* kbxutil::        Scrutinizing a keybox file.


File: gnupg.info,  Node: kbxutil,  Up: Debugging Tools

13.1.1 Scrutinizing a keybox file
---------------------------------

A keybox is a file format used to store public keys along with meta
information and indices.  The commonly used one is the file
'pubring.kbx' in the '.gnupg' directory.  It contains all X.509
certificates as well as OpenPGP keys.

When called the standard way, e.g.:

   'kbxutil ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'

it lists all records (called blobs) with there meta-information in a
human readable format.

To see statistics on the keybox in question, run it using

   'kbxutil --stats ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'

and you get an output like:

     Total number of blobs:       99
                    header:        1
                     empty:        0
                   openpgp:        0
                      x509:       98
               non flagged:       81
            secret flagged:        0
         ephemeral flagged:       17

   In this example you see that the keybox does not have any OpenPGP
keys but contains 98 X.509 certificates and a total of 17 keys or
certificates are flagged as ephemeral, meaning that they are only
temporary stored (cached) in the keybox and won't get listed using the
usual commands provided by 'gpgsm' or 'gpg'.  81 certificates are stored
in a standard way and directly available from 'gpgsm'.

To find duplicated certificates and keyblocks in a keybox file (this
should not occur but sometimes things go wrong), run it using

   'kbxutil --find-dups ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx'


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Debugging Hints,  Next: Common Problems,  Prev: Debugging Tools,  Up: Debugging

13.2 Various hints on debugging
===============================

   * How to find the IP address of a keyserver

     If a round robin URL of is used for a keyserver (e.g.
     subkeys.gnupg.org); it is not easy to see what server is actually
     used.  Using the keyserver debug option as in

           gpg --keyserver-options debug=1 -v --refresh-key 1E42B367

     is thus often helpful.  Note that the actual output depends on the
     backend and may change from release to release.

   * Logging on WindowsCE

     For development, the best logging method on WindowsCE is the use of
     remote debugging using a log file name of 'tcp://<ip-addr>:<port>'.
     The command 'watchgnupg' may be used on the remote host to listen
     on the given port (*note option watchgnupg --tcp::).  For in the
     field tests it is better to make use of the logging facility
     provided by the 'gpgcedev' driver (part of libassuan); this is
     enabled by using a log file name of 'GPG2:' (*note option
     --log-file::).


File: gnupg.info,  Node: Common Problems,  Next: Architecture Details,  Prev: Debugging Hints,  Up: Debugging

13.3 Commonly Seen Problems
===========================

   * Error code 'Not supported' from Dirmngr

     Most likely the option 'enable-ocsp' is active for gpgsm but
     Dirmngr's OCSP feature has not been enabled using 'allow-ocsp' in
     'dirmngr.conf'.

   * The Curses based Pinentry does not work

     The far most common reason for this is that the environment
     variable 'GPG_TTY' has not been set correctly.  Make sure that it
     has been set to a real tty device and not just to '/dev/tty'; i.e.
     'GPG_TTY=tty' is plainly wrong; what you want is 'GPG_TTY=`tty`' --
     note the back ticks.  Also make sure that this environment variable
     gets exported, that is you should follow up the setting with an
     'export GPG_TTY' (assuming a Bourne style shell).  Even for GUI
     based Pinentries; you should have set 'GPG_TTY'.  See the section
     on installing the 'gpg-agent' on how to do it.

   * SSH hangs while a popping up pinentry was expected

     SSH has no way to tell the gpg-agent what terminal or X display it
     is running on.  So when remotely logging into a box where a
     gpg-agent with SSH support is running, the pinentry will get popped
     up on whatever display the gpg-agent has been started.  To solve
     this problem you may issue the command

          echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent

     and the next pinentry will pop up on your display or screen.
     However, you need to kill the running pinentry first because only
     one pinentry may be running at once.  If you plan to use ssh on a
     new display you should issue the above command before invoking ssh
     or any other service making use of ssh.

   * Exporting a secret key without a certificate

     It may happen that you have created a certificate request using
     'gpgsm' but not yet received and imported the certificate from the
     CA. However, you want to export the secret key to another machine
     right now to import the certificate over there then.  You can do
     this with a little trick but it requires that you know the
     approximate time you created the signing request.  By running the
     command

            ls -ltr ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d

     you get a listing of all private keys under control of 'gpg-agent'.
     Pick the key which best matches the creation time and run the
     command

            /usr/local/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-export \
               ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/FOO >FOO.p12

     (Please adjust the path to 'gpg-protect-tool' to the appropriate
     location).  FOO is the name of the key file you picked (it should
     have the suffix '.key').  A Pinentry box will pop up and ask you
     for the current passphrase of the key and a new passphrase to
     protect it in the pkcs#12 file.

     To import the created file on the machine you use this command:

            /usr/local/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-import --store  FOO.p12

     You will be asked for the pkcs#12 passphrase and a new passphrase
     to protect the imported private key at its new location.

     Note that there is no easy way to match existing certificates with
     stored private keys because some private keys are used for Secure
     Shell or other purposes and don't have a corresponding certificate.

   * A root certificate does not verify

     A common problem is that the root certificate misses the required
     basicConstraints attribute and thus 'gpgsm' rejects this
     certificate.  An error message indicating "no value" is a sign for
     such a certificate.  You may use the 'relax' flag in
     'trustlist.txt' to accept the certificate anyway.  Note that the
     fingerprint and this flag may only be added manually to
     'trustlist.txt'.

   * Error message: "digest algorithm N has not been enabled"

     The signature is broken.  You may try the option
     '--extra-digest-algo SHA256' to workaround the problem.  The number
     N is the internal algorithm identifier; for example 8 refers to
     SHA-256.

   * The Windows version does not work under Wine

     When running the W32 version of 'gpg' under Wine you may get an
     error messages like:

          gpg: fatal: WriteConsole failed: Access denied

     The solution is to use the command 'wineconsole'.

     Some operations like '--generate-key' really want to talk to the
     console directly for increased security (for example to prevent the
     passphrase from appearing on the screen).  So, you should use
     'wineconsole' instead of 'wine', which will launch a windows
     console that implements those additional features.

   * Why does GPG's -search-key list weird keys?

     For performance reasons the keyservers do not check the keys the
     same way 'gpg' does.  It may happen that the listing of keys
     available on the keyservers shows keys with wrong user IDs or with
     user Ids from other keys.  If you try to import this key, the bad
     keys or bad user ids won't get imported, though.  This is a bit
     unfortunate but we can't do anything about it without actually
     downloading the keys.

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type 'show w'.  This is free software, and you are
     welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
     type 'show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Glossary
********

'ARL'
     The _Authority Revocation List_ is technical identical to a CRL but
     used for CAs and not for end user certificates.

'Chain model'
     Verification model for X.509 which uses the creation date of a
     signature as the date the validation starts and in turn checks that
     each certificate has been issued within the time frame, the issuing
     certificate was valid.  This allows the verification of signatures
     after the CA's certificate expired.  The validation test also
     required an online check of the certificate status.  The chain
     model is required by the German signature law.  See also _Shell
     model_.

'CMS'
     The _Cryptographic Message Standard_ describes a message format for
     encryption and digital signing.  It is closely related to the X.509
     certificate format.  CMS was formerly known under the name 'PKCS#7'
     and is described by 'RFC3369'.

'CRL'
     The _Certificate Revocation List_ is a list containing certificates
     revoked by the issuer.

'CSR'
     The _Certificate Signing Request_ is a message send to a CA to ask
     them to issue a new certificate.  The data format of such a signing
     request is called PCKS#10.

'OpenPGP'
     A data format used to build a PKI and to exchange encrypted or
     signed messages.  In contrast to X.509, OpenPGP also includes the
     message format but does not explicitly demand a specific PKI.
     However any kind of PKI may be build upon the OpenPGP protocol.

'Keygrip'
     This term is used by GnuPG to describe a 20 byte hash value used to
     identify a certain key without referencing to a concrete protocol.
     It is used internally to access a private key.  Usually it is shown
     and entered as a 40 character hexadecimal formatted string.

'OCSP'
     The _Online Certificate Status Protocol_ is used as an alternative
     to a CRL.  It is described in 'RFC 2560'.

'PSE'
     The _Personal Security Environment_ describes a database to store
     private keys.  This is either a smartcard or a collection of files
     on a disk; the latter is often called a Soft-PSE.

'Shell model'
     The standard model for validation of certificates under X.509.  At
     the time of the verification all certificates must be valid and not
     expired.  See also _Chain model_.

'X.509'
     Description of a PKI used with CMS. It is for example defined by
     'RFC3280'.
