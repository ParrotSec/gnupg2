# XXX: Currently, one cannot override automake's 'check' target.  As a
# workaround, we avoid defining 'TESTS', thus automake will not emit
# the 'check' target.  For extra robustness, we merely define a
# dependency on 'xcheck', so this hack should also work even if
# automake would emit the 'check' target, as adding dependencies to
# targets is okay.
